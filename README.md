# Xbox Music Player

Xbox Music Player is an application that let's you use the Xbox Music webapp as a native app, cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux) Desktop apps via Atom Shell.

### Getting Started

Xbox Music Player is based on Atom Shell Starter,

1. `script/bootstrap` - Run this once per checkout.
2. `script/build` - Run this whenever you change package.json or change early startup code
3. `script/run` - Run the app. Use this for running the app in developer mode

Another useful script is `script/grunt`, which will run the local version of Grunt. `script/grunt --help` will tell you the list of available tasks.
